# Reliability and Security Specification

## 14. Failure Model and Recovery Strategy

### 14.1 Failure Classes

1. `Workflow/Config Failures`
   - No active persisted workflow when the implementation requires one before dispatch
   - Invalid workflow config/package data
   - Unsupported tracker kind or missing tracker credentials/project slug
   - Missing coding-agent executable

2. `Workspace Failures`
   - Workspace directory creation failure
   - Workspace population/synchronization failure (implementation-defined; can come from hooks)
   - Invalid workspace path configuration
   - Hook timeout/failure

3. `Agent Session Failures`
   - Startup handshake failure
   - Turn failed/cancelled
   - Turn timeout
   - User input requested and handled as failure by the implementation's documented policy
   - Subprocess exit
   - Stalled session (no activity)

4. `Tracker Failures`
   - API transport errors
   - Non-200 status
   - GraphQL errors
   - malformed payloads

5. `Observability Failures`
   - Snapshot timeout
   - Dashboard render errors
   - Log sink configuration failure

### 14.2 Recovery Behavior

- Dispatch validation failures:
  - Skip new dispatches.
  - Keep service alive.
  - Continue reconciliation where possible.

- Worker failures:
  - Convert to retries with exponential backoff.

- Tracker candidate-fetch failures:
  - Skip this tick.
  - Try again on next tick.

- Reconciliation state-refresh failures:
  - Keep current workers.
  - Retry on next tick.

- Dashboard/log failures:
  - Do not crash the orchestrator.

### 14.3 Partial State Recovery (Restart)

Current design is intentionally in-memory for scheduler state.
Restart recovery means the service can resume useful operation by polling tracker state and reusing
preserved workspaces. It does not mean retry timers, running sessions, or live worker state survive
process restart.

After restart:

- No retry timers are restored from prior process memory.
- No running sessions are assumed recoverable.
- Service recovers by:
  - startup terminal workspace cleanup
  - fresh polling of active issues
  - re-dispatching eligible work

### 14.4 Operator Intervention Points

Operators can control behavior by:

- Editing the active workflow through the implementation control plane.
- Active workflow changes are detected and re-applied automatically without restart according to
  [spec-workflow-config §6.2](spec-workflow-config.md).
- Changing issue states in the tracker:
  - terminal state -> running session is stopped and workspace cleaned when reconciled
  - non-active state -> running session is stopped without cleanup
- Restarting the service for process recovery or deployment (not as the normal path for applying
  workflow config changes).

## 15. Security and Operational Safety

### 15.1 Trust Boundary Assumption

Each implementation defines its own trust boundary.

Operational safety requirements:

- Implementations SHOULD state clearly whether they are intended for trusted environments, more
  restrictive environments, or both.
- Implementations SHOULD state clearly whether they rely on auto-approved actions, operator
  approvals, stricter sandboxing, or some combination of those controls.
- Workspace isolation and path validation are important baseline controls, but they are not a
  substitute for whatever approval and sandbox policy an implementation chooses.

### 15.2 Filesystem Safety Requirements

Mandatory:

- Workspace path MUST remain under configured workspace root.
- Coding-agent cwd MUST be the per-issue workspace path for the current run.
- Workspace directory names MUST use sanitized identifiers.

RECOMMENDED additional hardening for ports:

- Run under a dedicated OS user.
- Restrict workspace root permissions.
- Mount workspace root on a dedicated volume if possible.

### 15.3 Secret Handling

- Support `$VAR` indirection in workflow config.
- Do not log API tokens or secret env values.
- Validate presence of secrets without printing them.

### 15.4 Hook Script Safety

Workspace hooks are arbitrary shell scripts from active workflow config.

Implications:

- Hooks are fully trusted configuration.
- Hooks run inside the workspace directory.
- Hook output SHOULD be truncated in logs.
- Hook timeouts are REQUIRED to avoid hanging the orchestrator.

### 15.5 Harness Hardening Guidance

Running Codex agents against repositories, issue trackers, and other inputs that can contain
sensitive data or externally-controlled content can be dangerous. A permissive deployment can lead
to data leaks, destructive mutations, or full machine compromise if the agent is induced to execute
harmful commands or use overly-powerful integrations.

Implementations SHOULD explicitly evaluate their own risk profile and harden the execution harness
where appropriate. This specification intentionally does not mandate a single hardening posture, but
implementations SHOULD NOT assume that tracker data, repository contents, prompt inputs, or tool
arguments are fully trustworthy just because they originate inside a normal workflow.

Possible hardening measures include:

- Tightening Codex approval and sandbox settings described elsewhere in this specification instead
  of running with a maximally permissive configuration.
- Adding external isolation layers such as OS/container/VM sandboxing, network restrictions, or
  separate credentials beyond the built-in Codex policy controls.
- Filtering which Linear issues, projects, teams, labels, or other tracker sources are eligible for
  dispatch so untrusted or out-of-scope tasks do not automatically reach the agent.
- Narrowing the `linear_graphql` tool so it can only read or mutate data inside the
  intended project scope, rather than exposing general workspace-wide tracker access.
- Reducing the set of client-side tools, credentials, filesystem paths, and network destinations
  available to the agent to the minimum needed for the workflow.

The correct controls are deployment-specific, but implementations SHOULD document them clearly and
treat harness hardening as part of the core safety model rather than an optional afterthought.
