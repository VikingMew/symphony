# Orchestration Specification

## 7. Orchestration State Machine

The orchestrator is the only component that mutates scheduling state. All worker outcomes are
reported back to it and converted into explicit state transitions.

### 7.1 Issue Orchestration States

This is not the same as tracker states (`Ready`, `In Progress`, etc.). This is the service's internal
claim state.

1. `Unclaimed`
   - Issue is not running and has no retry scheduled.

2. `Claimed`
   - Orchestrator has reserved the issue to prevent duplicate dispatch.
   - In practice, claimed issues are either `Running` or `RetryQueued`.

3. `Running`
   - Worker task exists and the issue is tracked in `running` map.

4. `RetryQueued`
   - Worker is not running, but a retry timer exists in `retry_attempts`.

5. `Released`
   - Claim removed because issue is terminal, non-active, missing, or retry path completed without
     re-dispatch.

6. `TrackerBlocked`
   - A persisted blocking decision owns the claim and suppresses poll, continuation, retry, and
     restart dispatch independently of the tracker write outcome.
   - A decision is created for normalized non-empty Codex blocker evidence, a typed terminal
     implementation-handoff failure, or two consecutive completed runs with no successful state
     transition or PR handoff. Crashes, stalls, and infrastructure/capacity failures do not advance
     that streak.
   - The backend retries the decision's Linear comment and `Blocked` transition without starting a
     coding-agent run. Human recovery clears both decision and streak; only an active target state
     becomes dispatchable again.

Important nuance:

- A successful worker exit does not mean the issue is done forever.
- The worker MAY continue through multiple back-to-back coding-agent turns before it exits.
- After each normal turn completion, the worker re-checks the tracker issue state.
- If the issue is still in an active state, the worker SHOULD start another turn on the same live
  coding-agent thread in the same workspace, up to `agent.max_turns`.
- The first turn SHOULD use the full rendered task prompt.
- Continuation turns SHOULD send only continuation guidance to the existing thread, not resend the
  original task prompt that is already present in thread history.
- Once the worker exits normally, the orchestrator still schedules a short continuation retry
  (about 1 second) so it can re-check whether the issue remains active and needs another worker
  session.

### 7.2 Run Attempt Lifecycle

A run attempt transitions through these phases:

1. `PreparingWorkspace`
2. `BuildingPrompt`
3. `LaunchingAgentProcess`
4. `InitializingSession`
5. `StreamingTurn`
6. `Finishing`
7. `Succeeded`
8. `Failed`
9. `TimedOut`
10. `Stalled`
11. `CanceledByReconciliation`

Distinct terminal reasons are important because retry logic and logs differ.

### 7.3 Transition Triggers

- `Poll Tick`
  - Reconcile active runs.
  - Validate config.
  - Fetch candidate issues.
  - Dispatch until slots are exhausted.

- `Worker Exit (normal)`
  - Remove running entry.
  - Update aggregate runtime totals.
  - Schedule continuation retry (attempt `1`) after the worker exhausts or finishes its in-process
    turn loop.

- `Worker Exit (abnormal)`
  - Remove running entry.
  - Update aggregate runtime totals.
  - Schedule exponential-backoff retry.

- `Codex Update Event`
  - Update live session fields, token counters, and rate limits.

- `Retry Timer Fired`
  - Re-fetch active candidates and attempt re-dispatch, or release claim if no longer eligible.

- `Reconciliation State Refresh`
  - Stop runs whose issue states are terminal or no longer active.

- `Stall Timeout`
  - Kill worker and schedule retry.

### 7.4 Idempotency and Recovery Rules

- The orchestrator serializes state mutations through one authority to avoid duplicate dispatch.
- `claimed` and `running` checks are REQUIRED before launching any worker.
- Reconciliation runs before dispatch on every tick.
- Restart recovery is tracker-driven and filesystem-driven (without a durable orchestrator DB).
- Startup terminal cleanup removes stale workspaces for issues already in terminal states.

## 8. Polling, Scheduling, and Reconciliation

### 8.1 Poll Loop

At startup, the service validates config, performs startup cleanup, schedules an immediate tick, and
then repeats every `polling.interval_ms`.

The effective poll interval SHOULD be updated when workflow config changes are re-applied.

Tick sequence:

1. Reconcile running issues.
2. Run dispatch preflight validation.
3. For each enabled project, fetch candidate issues from that project's tracker using its active
   states and per-project concurrency budget.
4. Sort issues by dispatch priority.
5. Dispatch eligible issues while slots remain (global limit remains the outer bound).
6. Notify observability/status consumers of state changes.

If per-tick validation fails, dispatch is skipped for that tick, but reconciliation still happens
first. A project whose config fails validation logs its own error and does not prevent other
enabled projects from dispatching.

### 8.2 Candidate Selection Rules

An issue is dispatch-eligible only if all are true:

- It has `id`, `identifier`, `title`, and `state`.
- Its state is in `active_states` and not in `terminal_states`.
- It is not already in `running`.
- It is not already in `claimed`.
- Deployment concurrency slots are available.
- Blocker rule for `Ready` state passes:
  - If the issue state is `Ready`, do not dispatch when any blocker is non-terminal.

The default active states are `Refining`, `Ready`, and `In Progress`. The human-review states
`Needs Refinement Review` and `Ready to Merge` are deliberately absent from `active_states` and
MUST NOT have executable routes. The control plane MAY transition `Ready to Merge -> Blocked`
without dispatch when the exact handed-off open GitHub PR reports a definitive merge conflict.
Unknown mergeability, CI, review, behind, or API failure states MUST NOT block. In particular, no
orchestrator path transitions `Ready to Merge`
to `Done`; GitHub review plus Linear automation owns that transition.

Sorting order (stable intent):

1. `priority` ascending (1..4 are preferred; null/unknown sorts last)
2. `created_at` oldest first
3. `identifier` lexicographic tie-breaker

### 8.3 Concurrency Control

Capacity is deployment topology and is shared by every enabled project. In centralized mode,
`SYMPHONY_PANEL_SLOTS` is the bounded deployment limit and available capacity subtracts the
orchestrator `running` count. In worker mode, capacity is the sum of `total_slots` advertised by
online worker sessions with a fresh heartbeat, less worker tasks in `queued`, `leased`, or
`running`. No online fresh worker therefore means zero capacity. Each successful enqueue is
visible to the next candidate in the same reduce. Worker claims additionally require the
worker's current `available_slots` to be positive.

Candidate dispatch and retry use this same execution-mode-aware capacity decision. Capacity
rejection emits `global_capacity` skip evidence and never falls back to a workflow field.

### 8.4 Retry and Backoff

Retry entry creation:

- Cancel any existing retry timer for the same issue.
- Store `attempt`, `identifier`, `error`, `due_at_ms`, and new timer handle.

Backoff formula:

- Normal continuation retries after a clean worker exit use a short fixed delay of `1000` ms.
- Failure-driven retries use `delay = min(10000 * 2^(attempt - 1), agent.max_retry_backoff_ms)`.
- Power is capped by the configured max retry backoff (default `300000` / 5m).

Retry handling behavior:

1. Fetch active candidate issues (not all issues).
2. Find the specific issue by `issue_id`.
3. If not found, release claim.
4. If found and still candidate-eligible:
   - Dispatch if slots are available.
   - Otherwise requeue with error `no available orchestrator slots`.
5. If found but no longer active, release claim.

Note:

- Terminal-state workspace cleanup is handled by startup cleanup and active-run reconciliation
  (including terminal transitions for currently running issues).
- Retry handling mainly operates on active candidates and releases claims when the issue is absent,
  rather than performing terminal cleanup itself.

### 8.5 Active Run Reconciliation

Reconciliation runs every tick and has two parts.

Part A: Stall detection

- For each running issue, compute `elapsed_ms` since:
  - `last_codex_timestamp` if any event has been seen, else
  - `started_at`
- If `elapsed_ms > codex.stall_timeout_ms`, terminate the worker and queue a retry.
- If `stall_timeout_ms <= 0`, skip stall detection entirely.

Part B: Tracker state refresh

- Fetch current issue states for all running issue IDs.
- For each running issue:
  - If tracker state is terminal: terminate worker and clean workspace.
  - If tracker state is still active: update the in-memory issue snapshot.
  - If tracker state is neither active nor terminal: terminate worker without workspace cleanup.
- If state refresh fails, keep workers running and try again on the next tick.

### 8.6 Startup Terminal Workspace Cleanup

When the service starts:

1. Query tracker for issues in terminal states.
2. For each returned issue identifier, remove the corresponding workspace directory.
3. If the terminal-issues fetch fails, log a warning and continue startup.

This prevents stale terminal workspaces from accumulating after restarts.

## 9. Workspace Management and Safety

### 9.1 Workspace Layout

Workspace root:

- `workspace.root` (normalized absolute path)

Per-issue workspace path:

- `<workspace.root>/<sanitized_issue_identifier>`

Workspace persistence:

- Workspaces are reused across runs for the same issue.
- Successful runs do not auto-delete workspaces.

### 9.2 Workspace Creation and Reuse

Input: `issue.identifier`

Algorithm summary:

1. Sanitize identifier to `workspace_key`.
2. Compute workspace path under workspace root.
3. Ensure the workspace path exists as a directory.
4. Mark `created_now=true` only if the directory was created during this call; otherwise
   `created_now=false`.
5. If `created_now=true`, run `after_create` hook if configured.

Notes:

- This section does not assume any specific repository/VCS workflow.
- Workspace preparation beyond directory creation (for example dependency bootstrap, checkout/sync,
  code generation) is implementation-defined and is typically handled via hooks.

### 9.3 OPTIONAL Workspace Population (Implementation-Defined)

The spec does not require any built-in VCS or repository bootstrap behavior.

Implementations MAY populate or synchronize the workspace using implementation-defined logic and/or
hooks (for example `after_create` and/or `before_run`).

Failure handling:

- Workspace population/synchronization failures return an error for the current attempt.
- If failure happens while creating a brand-new workspace, implementations MAY remove the partially
  prepared directory.
- Reused workspaces SHOULD NOT be destructively reset on population failure unless that policy is
  explicitly chosen and documented.

### 9.4 Workspace Hooks

Supported hooks:

- `hooks.after_create`
- `hooks.before_run`
- `hooks.after_run`
- `hooks.before_remove`

Hooks are defined at the workflow level and MAY be overridden per project through the Project
settings record. A non-blank project hook replaces the workflow-level hook for that project;
unset project hooks leave the workflow-level hook intact.

Execution contract:

- Execute in a local shell context appropriate to the host OS, with the workspace directory as
  `cwd`.
- On POSIX systems, `sh -lc <script>` (or a stricter equivalent such as `bash -lc <script>`) is a
  conforming default.
- Hook timeout uses `hooks.timeout_ms`; default: `60000 ms`.
- Log hook start, failures, and timeouts.

Failure semantics:

- `after_create` failure or timeout is fatal to workspace creation.
- `before_run` failure or timeout is fatal to the current run attempt.
- `after_run` failure or timeout is logged and ignored.
- `before_remove` failure or timeout is logged and ignored.

### 9.5 Safety Invariants

This is the most important portability constraint.

Invariant 1: Run the coding agent only in the per-issue workspace path.

- Before launching the coding-agent subprocess, validate:
  - `cwd == workspace_path`

Invariant 2: Workspace path MUST stay inside workspace root.

- Normalize both paths to absolute.
- Require `workspace_path` to have `workspace_root` as a prefix directory.
- Reject any path outside the workspace root.

Invariant 3: Workspace key is sanitized.

- Only `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` allowed in workspace directory names.
- Replace all other characters with `_`.
