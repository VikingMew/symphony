# Test and Validation Matrix

## 17. Test and Validation Matrix

A conforming implementation SHOULD include tests that cover the behaviors defined in this
specification.

Validation profiles:

- `Core Conformance`: deterministic tests REQUIRED for all conforming implementations.
- `Extension Conformance`: REQUIRED only for OPTIONAL features that an implementation chooses to
  ship.
- `Real Integration Profile`: environment-dependent smoke/integration checks RECOMMENDED before
  production use.

Unless otherwise noted, Sections 17.1 through 17.7 are `Core Conformance`. Bullets that begin with
`If ... is implemented` are `Extension Conformance`.

### 17.1 Workflow and Config Parsing

- Active workflow selection is datastore-backed and operator-visible
- Active workflow changes are detected and trigger re-read/re-apply without restart
- Invalid workflow reload keeps last known good effective configuration and emits an
  operator-visible error
- Missing active workflow returns typed setup-required error
- Invalid workflow package/config data returns typed error
- Non-map package/config roots return typed error
- Config defaults apply when OPTIONAL values are missing
- `tracker.kind` validation enforces currently supported kind (`linear`)
- `tracker.api_key` works (including `$VAR` indirection)
- `$VAR` resolution works for tracker API key and path values
- `~` path expansion works
- `codex.command` is preserved as a shell command string
- Per-state concurrency override map normalizes state names and ignores invalid values
- Prompt template renders `issue` and `attempt`
- Prompt rendering fails on unknown variables (strict mode)

### 17.2 Workspace Manager and Safety

- Deterministic workspace path per issue identifier
- Missing workspace directory is created
- Existing workspace directory is removed and recreated before each new agent start
- Existing non-directory path at workspace location is handled safely (replace or fail per
  implementation policy)
- OPTIONAL workspace population/synchronization errors are surfaced
- Structured project checkout/setup runs before `after_create`
- `after_create` hook runs on every fresh workspace creation
- `before_run` hook runs before each attempt and failure/timeouts abort the current attempt
- `after_run` hook runs after each attempt and failure/timeouts are logged and ignored
- `before_remove` hook runs on cleanup and failures/timeouts are ignored
- Workspace path sanitization and root containment invariants are enforced before agent launch
- Agent launch uses the per-issue workspace path as cwd and rejects out-of-root paths

### 17.3 Issue Tracker Client

- Candidate issue fetch uses active states and project slug
- Linear query uses the specified project filter field (`slugId`)
- Empty `fetch_issues_by_states([])` returns empty without API call
- Pagination preserves order across multiple pages
- Blockers are normalized from inverse relations of type `blocks`
- Labels are normalized to lowercase
- Issue state refresh by ID returns minimal normalized issues
- Issue state refresh query uses GraphQL ID typing (`[ID!]`) as specified in [spec-linear-integration §11.2](spec-linear-integration.md)
- Error mapping for request errors, non-200, GraphQL errors, malformed payloads

### 17.4 Orchestrator Dispatch, Reconciliation, and Retry

- Dispatch sort order is priority then oldest creation time
- `Ready` issue with non-terminal blockers is not eligible
- `Ready` issue with terminal blockers is eligible
- Active-state issue refresh updates running entry state
- Non-active state stops running agent without workspace cleanup
- Terminal state stops running agent and cleans workspace
- Reconciliation with no running issues is a no-op
- Normal worker exit schedules a short continuation retry (attempt 1)
- Abnormal worker exit increments retries with 10s-based exponential backoff
- Retry backoff cap uses configured `agent.max_retry_backoff_ms`
- Retry queue entries include attempt, due time, identifier, and error
- Stall detection kills stalled sessions and schedules retry
- Slot exhaustion requeues retries with explicit error reason
- If a snapshot API is implemented, it returns running rows, retry rows, token totals, and rate
  limits
- If a snapshot API is implemented, timeout/unavailable cases are surfaced

### 17.5 Coding-Agent App-Server Client

- Launch command uses workspace cwd and invokes `bash -lc <codex.command>`
- Session startup follows the targeted Codex app-server protocol.
- Client identity/capability payloads are valid when the targeted Codex app-server protocol requires
  them.
- Policy-related startup payloads use the implementation's documented approval/sandbox settings
- Thread and turn identities exposed by the targeted protocol are extracted and used to emit
  `session_started`
- Request/response read timeout is enforced
- Turn timeout is enforced
- Transport framing required by the targeted protocol is handled correctly
- For stdio-based transports, diagnostic stderr handling is kept separate from the protocol stream
- Command/file-change approvals are handled according to the implementation's documented policy
- Unsupported dynamic tool calls are rejected without stalling the session
- User input requests are handled according to the implementation's documented policy and do not
  stall indefinitely
- Usage and rate-limit telemetry exposed by the targeted protocol is extracted
- Approval, user-input-required, usage, and rate-limit signals are interpreted according to the
  targeted protocol
- If client-side tools are implemented, session startup advertises the supported tool specs
  using the targeted app-server protocol
- If the `linear_graphql` client-side tool extension is implemented:
  - the tool is advertised to the session
  - valid `query` / `variables` inputs execute against configured Linear auth
  - top-level GraphQL `errors` produce `success=false` while preserving the GraphQL body
  - invalid arguments, missing auth, and transport failures return structured failure payloads
  - unsupported tool names still fail without stalling the session

### 17.6 Observability

- Validation failures are operator-visible
- Structured logging includes issue/session context fields
- Logging sink failures do not crash orchestration
- Token/rate-limit aggregation remains correct across repeated agent updates
- If a human-readable status surface is implemented, it is driven from orchestrator state and does
  not affect correctness
- If humanized event summaries are implemented, they cover key wrapper/agent event classes without
  changing orchestrator behavior

### 17.7 CLI and Host Lifecycle

- CLI accepts runtime options such as port and datastore location
- CLI does not require a workflow path argument
- CLI can start in setup-required mode without an active workflow when the control plane can create
  or select one before dispatch
- CLI surfaces startup failure cleanly
- CLI exits with success when application starts and shuts down normally
- CLI exits nonzero when startup fails or the host process exits abnormally

### 17.8 Real Integration Profile (RECOMMENDED)

These checks are RECOMMENDED for production readiness and MAY be skipped in CI when credentials,
network access, or external service permissions are unavailable.

- A real tracker smoke test can be run with valid credentials supplied by `LINEAR_API_KEY` or a
  documented local bootstrap mechanism (for example `~/.linear_api_key`).
- Real integration tests SHOULD use isolated test identifiers/workspaces and clean up tracker
  artifacts when practical.
- A skipped real-integration test SHOULD be reported as skipped, not silently treated as passed.
- If a real-integration profile is explicitly enabled in CI or release validation, failures SHOULD
  fail that job.

## 18. Implementation Checklist (Definition of Done)

Use the same validation profiles as Section 17:

- Section 18.1 = `Core Conformance`
- Section 18.2 = `Extension Conformance`
- Section 18.3 = `Real Integration Profile`

### 18.1 REQUIRED for Conformance

- Workflow path selection supports explicit runtime path and cwd default
- Active workflow loader with config + prompt/profile data
- Typed config layer with defaults and `$` resolution
- Dynamic active workflow reload/re-apply for config and prompt
- Polling orchestrator with single-authority mutable state
- Issue tracker client with candidate fetch + state refresh + terminal fetch
- Workspace manager with sanitized per-issue workspaces
- Workspace lifecycle hooks (`after_create`, `before_run`, `after_run`, `before_remove`)
- Hook timeout config (`hooks.timeout_ms`, default `60000`)
- Coding-agent app-server subprocess client with JSON line protocol
- Codex launch command config (`codex.command`, default `codex app-server`)
- Strict prompt rendering with `issue` and `attempt` variables
- Exponential retry queue with continuation retries after normal exit
- Configurable retry backoff cap (`agent.max_retry_backoff_ms`, default 5m)
- Reconciliation that stops runs on terminal/non-active tracker states
- Workspace cleanup for terminal issues (startup sweep + active transition)
- Structured logs with `issue_id`, `issue_identifier`, and `session_id`
- Operator-visible observability (structured logs; OPTIONAL snapshot/status surface)

### 18.2 RECOMMENDED Extensions (Not REQUIRED for Conformance)

- HTTP server extension honors CLI `--port` over `server.port`, uses a safe default bind host, and
  exposes the baseline endpoints/error semantics in [spec-observability §13.7](spec-observability.md) if shipped.
- `linear_graphql` client-side tool extension exposes raw Linear GraphQL access through the
  app-server session using configured Symphony auth.
- TODO: Persist retry queue and session metadata across process restarts.
- TODO: Make observability settings configurable in active workflow config without prescribing UI
  implementation details.
- TODO: Add first-class tracker write APIs (comments/state transitions) in the orchestrator instead
  of only via agent tools.
- TODO: Add pluggable issue tracker adapters beyond Linear.

### 18.3 Operational Validation Before Production (RECOMMENDED)

- Run the `Real Integration Profile` from Section 17.8 with valid credentials and network access.
- Verify hook execution and runtime path resolution on the target host OS/shell environment.
- If the OPTIONAL HTTP server is shipped, verify the configured port behavior and loopback/default
  bind expectations on the target environment.
