# Agent Runner Protocol Specification

## 10. Agent Runner Protocol (Coding Agent Integration)

This section defines Symphony's language-neutral responsibilities when integrating a Codex
app-server. The Codex app-server protocol for the targeted Codex version is the source of truth for
protocol schemas, message payloads, transport framing, and method names.

Protocol source of truth:

- Implementations MUST send messages that are valid for the targeted Codex app-server version.
- Implementations MUST consult the targeted Codex app-server documentation or generated schema
  instead of treating this specification as a protocol schema.
- If this specification appears to conflict with the targeted Codex app-server protocol, the Codex
  protocol controls protocol shape and transport behavior.
- Symphony-specific requirements in this section still control orchestration behavior, workspace
  selection, prompt construction, continuation handling, and observability extraction.

### 10.1 Launch Contract

Subprocess launch parameters:

- Command: `codex.command`
- Invocation: `bash -lc <codex.command>`
- Working directory: workspace path
- Transport/framing: the protocol transport required by the targeted Codex app-server version

Notes:

- The default command is `codex app-server`.
- Approval policy, sandbox policy, cwd, prompt input, and OPTIONAL tool declarations are supplied
  using fields supported by the targeted Codex app-server version.

RECOMMENDED additional process settings:

- Max line size: 10 MB (for safe buffering)

### 10.2 Session Startup Responsibilities

Reference: https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server/

Startup MUST follow the targeted Codex app-server contract. Symphony additionally requires the
client to:

- Start the app-server subprocess in the per-issue workspace.
- Initialize the app-server session using the targeted Codex app-server protocol.
- Create or resume a coding-agent thread according to the targeted protocol.
- Supply the absolute per-issue workspace path as the thread/turn working directory wherever the
  targeted protocol accepts cwd.
- Start the first turn with the rendered issue prompt.
- Start later in-worker continuation turns on the same live thread with continuation guidance rather
  than resending the original issue prompt.
- Supply the implementation's documented approval and sandbox policy using fields supported by the
  targeted protocol.
- Include issue-identifying metadata, such as `<issue.identifier>: <issue.title>`, when the targeted
  protocol supports turn or session titles.
- Advertise implemented client-side tools using the targeted protocol.

Session identifiers:

- Extract `thread_id` from the thread identity returned by the targeted Codex app-server protocol.
- Extract `turn_id` from each turn identity returned by the targeted Codex app-server protocol.
- Emit `session_id = "<thread_id>-<turn_id>"`
- Reuse the same `thread_id` for all continuation turns inside one worker run

### 10.3 Streaming Turn Processing

The client processes app-server updates according to the targeted Codex app-server protocol until
the active turn terminates.

Completion conditions:

- Targeted-protocol turn completion signal -> success
- Targeted-protocol turn failure signal -> failure
- Targeted-protocol turn cancellation signal -> failure
- turn timeout (`turn_timeout_ms`) -> failure
- subprocess exit -> failure

Continuation processing:

- If the worker decides to continue after a successful turn, it SHOULD start another turn on the same
  live thread using the targeted protocol.
- The app-server subprocess SHOULD remain alive across those continuation turns and be stopped only
  when the worker run is ending.

Transport handling requirements:

- Follow the transport and framing rules of the targeted Codex app-server version.
- For stdio-based transports, keep protocol stream handling separate from diagnostic stderr
  handling unless the targeted protocol specifies otherwise.

### 10.4 Emitted Runtime Events (Upstream to Orchestrator)

The app-server client emits structured events to the orchestrator callback. Each event SHOULD
include:

- `event` (enum/string)
- `timestamp` (UTC timestamp)
- `codex_app_server_pid` (if available)
- OPTIONAL `usage` map (token counts)
- payload fields as needed

Important emitted events include, for example:

- `session_started`
- `startup_failed`
- `turn_completed`
- `turn_failed`
- `turn_cancelled`
- `turn_ended_with_error`
- `turn_input_required`
- `approval_auto_approved`
- `unsupported_tool_call`
- `notification`
- `other_message`
- `malformed`

### 10.5 Approval, Tool Calls, and User Input Policy

Approval, sandbox, and user-input behavior is implementation-defined.

Policy requirements:

- Each implementation MUST document its chosen approval, sandbox, and operator-confirmation
  posture.
- Approval requests and user-input-required events MUST NOT leave a run stalled indefinitely. An
  implementation MAY either satisfy them, surface them to an operator, auto-resolve them, or
  fail the run according to its documented policy.

Example high-trust behavior:

- Auto-approve command execution approvals for the session.
- Auto-approve file-change approvals for the session.
- Treat user-input-required turns as hard failure.

Unsupported dynamic tool calls:

- Supported dynamic tool calls that are explicitly implemented and advertised by the runtime SHOULD
  be handled according to their extension contract.
- If the agent requests a dynamic tool call that is not supported, return a tool failure response
  using the targeted protocol and continue the session.
- This prevents the session from stalling on unsupported tool execution paths.

Optional client-side tool extension:

- An implementation MAY expose a limited set of client-side tools to the app-server session.
- Current standardized optional tool: `linear_graphql`.
- If implemented, supported tools SHOULD be advertised to the app-server session during startup
  using the protocol mechanism supported by the targeted Codex app-server version.
- Unsupported tool names SHOULD still return a failure result using the targeted protocol and
  continue the session.

`linear_graphql` extension contract:

- Purpose: execute a raw GraphQL query or mutation against Linear using Symphony's configured
  tracker auth for the current session.
- Availability: only meaningful when `tracker.kind == "linear"` and valid Linear auth is configured.
- Preferred input shape:

  ```json
  {
    "query": "single GraphQL query or mutation document",
    "variables": {
      "optional": "graphql variables object"
    }
  }
  ```

- `query` MUST be a non-empty string.
- `query` MUST contain exactly one GraphQL operation.
- `variables` is OPTIONAL and, when present, MUST be a JSON object.
- Implementations MAY additionally accept a raw GraphQL query string as shorthand input.
- Execute one GraphQL operation per tool call.
- If the provided document contains multiple operations, reject the tool call as invalid input.
- `operationName` selection is intentionally out of scope for this extension.
- Reuse the configured Linear endpoint and auth from the active Symphony workflow/runtime config; do
  not require the coding agent to read raw tokens from disk.
- Tool result semantics:
  - transport success + no top-level GraphQL `errors` -> `success=true`
  - top-level GraphQL `errors` present -> `success=false`, but preserve the GraphQL response body
    for debugging
  - invalid input, missing auth, or transport failure -> `success=false` with an error payload
- Return the GraphQL response or error payload as structured tool output that the model can inspect
  in-session.

User-input-required policy:

- Implementations MUST document how targeted-protocol user-input-required signals are handled.
- A run MUST NOT stall indefinitely waiting for user input.
- A conforming implementation MAY fail the run, surface the request to an operator, satisfy it
  through an approved operator channel, or auto-resolve it according to its documented policy.
- The example high-trust behavior above fails user-input-required turns immediately.

### 10.6 Timeouts and Error Mapping

Timeouts:

- `codex.read_timeout_ms`: request/response timeout during startup and sync requests
- `codex.turn_timeout_ms`: total turn stream timeout
- `codex.stall_timeout_ms`: enforced by orchestrator based on event inactivity

Error mapping (RECOMMENDED normalized categories):

- `codex_not_found`
- `invalid_workspace_cwd`
- `response_timeout`
- `turn_timeout`
- `port_exit`
- `response_error`
- `turn_failed`
- `turn_cancelled`
- `turn_input_required`

### 10.7 Agent Runner Contract

The `Agent Runner` wraps workspace + prompt + app-server client.

Behavior:

1. Create/reuse workspace for issue.
2. Build prompt from workflow template.
3. Start app-server session.
4. Forward app-server events to orchestrator.
5. Treat only an explicit allowed `Ready to Merge` request as implementation completion.
6. On any error, fail the worker attempt (the orchestrator will retry).

Note:

- Workspaces are intentionally preserved after successful runs.
- A normal app-server turn completion or `agent.max_turns` exhaustion MUST NOT create a PR or move
  an issue to `Ready to Merge`.

### 10.8 Centralized GitHub PR Handoff

For the default implementation profile, `AgentRunner` owns this ordered boundary:

1. Receive an explicit `Ready to Merge` request containing final comment, structured result, and
   references; render the initial title/body from `result.completed`, `result.validation`, and the
   issue identity according to [pull-request-body.md](pull-request-body.md).
2. Validate the Linear identifier/title, exact Linear `branchName`, configured default branch,
   GitHub repository identity, and existence of the remote head branch.
3. Ensure an open PR exists for the exact repository/base/head tuple.
4. Attach the PR URL and post the final Linear comment/result/references.
5. Update Linear from `In Progress` to `Ready to Merge` last.

Step 5 MUST NOT run if PR preparation fails. Failures MUST be typed, visible, redacted, and leave
the issue in `In Progress`. Started/completed/failed `implementation_handoff` phase events MUST
carry issue, session, and run context; completed events record the PR URL.

PR lookup/creation requirements:

- Discover `gh` from the service process environment and use non-interactive, timeout-bounded
  commands.
- Look up before create and return an existing open PR without duplication.
- Create against the configured default branch with the exact validated head and the already
  validated renderer title/body. The body contains Summary bullets, Test Plan checkboxes, and the
  exact `Fixes <ID>` closing reference required by [pull-request-body.md](pull-request-body.md).
- Return an existing exact open PR without changing its title or body.
- If `gh` is unavailable or unusable, use GitHub REST through the existing HTTP/proxy stack when
  `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` is present; do not add a workflow token setting.
- A closed or merged PR for the same branch is a typed conflict, not success and not permission to
  create an ambiguous duplicate.
- Repository identity mismatch, missing remote branch/auth, CLI/API errors, and Linear transition
  failure are typed errors. Logs and returned command output MUST redact token values.
- Resolution MUST NOT depend on the centralized host having the worker workspace, which preserves
  SSH-host execution.

## 12. Prompt Construction and Context Assembly

### 12.1 Inputs

Inputs to prompt rendering:

- `workflow.prompt_template`
- normalized `issue` object
- OPTIONAL `attempt` integer (retry/continuation metadata)

### 12.2 Rendering Rules

- Render with strict variable checking.
- Render with strict filter checking.
- Convert issue object keys to strings for template compatibility.
- Preserve nested arrays/maps (labels, blockers) so templates can iterate.

### 12.3 Retry/Continuation Semantics

`attempt` SHOULD be passed to the template because the workflow prompt can provide different
instructions for:

- first run (`attempt` null or absent)
- continuation run after a successful prior session
- retry after error/timeout/stall

### 12.4 Failure Semantics

If prompt rendering fails:

- Fail the run attempt immediately.
- Let the orchestrator treat it like any other worker failure and decide retry behavior.

## Appendix A. SSH Worker Extension (OPTIONAL)

This appendix describes a common extension profile in which Symphony keeps one central
orchestrator but executes worker runs on one or more remote hosts over SSH.

Extension config:

- `worker.ssh_hosts` (list of SSH host strings, OPTIONAL)
  - When omitted, work runs locally.
- `worker.max_concurrent_agents_per_host` (positive integer, OPTIONAL)
  - Shared per-host cap applied across configured SSH hosts.

### A.1 Execution Model

- The orchestrator remains the single source of truth for polling, claims, retries, and
  reconciliation.
- `worker.ssh_hosts` provides the candidate SSH destinations for remote execution.
- Each worker run is assigned to one host at a time, and that host becomes part of the run's
  effective execution identity along with the issue workspace.
- `workspace.root` is interpreted on the remote host, not on the orchestrator host.
- The coding-agent app-server is launched over SSH stdio instead of as a local subprocess, so the
  orchestrator still owns the session lifecycle even though commands execute remotely.
- Continuation turns inside one worker lifetime SHOULD stay on the same host and workspace.
- A remote host SHOULD satisfy the same basic contract as a local worker environment: reachable
  shell, writable workspace root, coding-agent executable, and any required auth or repository
  prerequisites.

### A.2 Scheduling Notes

- SSH hosts MAY be treated as a pool for dispatch.
- Implementations MAY prefer the previously used host on retries when that host is still
  available.
- `worker.max_concurrent_agents_per_host` is an OPTIONAL shared per-host cap across configured SSH
  hosts.
- When all SSH hosts are at capacity, dispatch SHOULD wait rather than silently falling back to a
  different execution mode.
- Implementations MAY fail over to another host when the original host is unavailable before work
  has meaningfully started.
- Once a run has already produced side effects, a transparent rerun on another host SHOULD be
  treated as a new attempt, not as invisible failover.

### A.3 Problems to Consider

- Remote environment drift:
  - Each host needs the expected shell environment, coding-agent executable, auth, and repository
    prerequisites.
- Workspace locality:
  - Workspaces are usually host-local, so moving an issue to a different host is typically a cold
    restart unless shared storage exists.
- Path and command safety:
  - Remote path resolution, shell quoting, and workspace-boundary checks matter more once execution
    crosses a machine boundary.
- Startup and failover semantics:
  - Implementations SHOULD distinguish host-connectivity/startup failures from in-workspace agent
    failures so the same ticket is not accidentally re-executed on multiple hosts.
- Host health and saturation:
  - A dead or overloaded host SHOULD reduce available capacity, not cause duplicate execution or an
    accidental fallback to local work.
- Cleanup and observability:
  - Operators need to know which host owns a run, where its workspace lives, and whether cleanup
    happened on the right machine.
